                    <p> The purpose of this meeting is to brainstorm ideas for what features our 
                        we want our pomodoro timer to include. We will first discuss the core features our timer <em>must</em> contain, and
                        then move over to a conversation about extra features (add-ons) that would be cool to have and 
                        make the end user experience better. Participants are encouraged to go wild with
                        their ideas as we are simply just trying to come up with some unique and interesting features to implement
                        that would make our app stand out from the crowd. No ideas will be rejected in this meeting, but we will vote on ideas worth keeping in
                        the next session.

            <p> Today we discussed the features our pomodoro timer must have in order for the project to be considered successful.
                Note that anything beyond these agreed upon specifications (see Essentials below) are considered "<i>icing on the cake</i>" and should only be implemented
                if time permits.</p>

                <h4> Essentials: </h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Timer must alternate between <strong>work</strong> and <b>break</b> sessions </li>
                        <li> Work sessions should be <em>25</em> minutes long by default</li>
                        <li> Break sessions should be <em>5</em> minutes long by default</li>
                        <li> Every third break session should be <em>15</em> minutes long</li>
                        <li> There must be a clear indicator for the time remaining in the current work/break session </li>
                        <li> The user must be able to clearly tell whether they are currently in an active work or break session</li>
                        <li> The user must be able to pause the timer in the middle of any session</li>
                        <li> The user must be able to restart/stop the timer (restart the timer and clear history of current number of work/break sessions taken)</li>
                        <li> The user must be alerted when the timer expires for the current work/break session</li>
                    </ol>
                <h4> Add-ons </h4>
                    <ol>
                       <li> Add ability to customize work/break session duration</li> 
                       <li> Add custom notification method (sound, text notification, etc) </li>
                       <li> Add pomodoro timer history so users can track the number of pomodoro sessions completed </li>
                       <li> Add custom UI to replace/accompany countdown timer</li>
                    </ol>
